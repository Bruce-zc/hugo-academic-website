title: (AI - Differential Equations) Research on Data-Driven AI Automated Scientific Exploration Topics.
summary: Introduce a joint spatial-temporal evolution network which incorporates spatial dynamics modeling into the temporal evolution prediction for robust learning the evolution operator with very few samples. Our approach can iscover new locations to collect more critical samples based on multi-step reciprocal prediction error generated by a prediction loop of forward and backward networks.
