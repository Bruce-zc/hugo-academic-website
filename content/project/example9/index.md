title: (ML - Transfer Learning) Neuro-Modulated Hebbian Learning for Fully Test-Time Adaptation.
summary: We combined unsupervised Hebbian learning and neuro-modulator to update the source model during inference stage and ncorporated a soft decision rule into the feed-forward Hebbian learning to improve its competitive learning. Our proposed method outperformed the previous state-of-the-art by 1.4%, 2.4%, 2.3% on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C and ImageNet-C datasets.
